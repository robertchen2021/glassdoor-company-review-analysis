# Glassdoor Company Review Analysis with NLP
Springboard Data Science course capstone project 2. 

## Project Overview:
This project is a Glassdoor company review analysis on a large company. The coding consists of 3 Jupyter Notebooks.

Part 1: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
Part 2: Sentiment Analysis<br>
Part 3: Keywords Extraction and Topic Modeling<br>

## Problem Statement:
This analysis aims to build a workflow for Glassdoor employee review tasks. Although the data in this project is about one company, the techniques can be applied to any mid-large sized company that has enough Glassdoor reviews.

Specifically, we will find answer to these questions: what employees like and dislike about their company? Has the companyâ€™s reputation gotten better or worse over the years? What are the keywords that employees are talking about this company? What can this company do to improve employee engagement?
